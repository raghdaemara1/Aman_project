# IntelliDoc — Insurance Document Intelligence Agent Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Full-Stack Separation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The application MUST maintain a strict boundary between frontend and backend:

- **Frontend**: React.js (TypeScript) — UI only, no business logic, no direct LLM calls
- **Backend**: Python / FastAPI — all AI/ML logic, PDF processing, vector search, agent reasoning
- Communication MUST use a versioned REST API (`/api/v1/...`)
- Frontend MUST never import Python packages or call OpenAI directly
- Each layer is independently runnable, testable, and deployable

**Rationale**: The demo must reflect production architecture at AMAN scale. Mixing UI and AI logic in Streamlit would not demonstrate the engineering depth expected of an Agentic AI Lead.

### II. Agentic Reasoning — Two-Tool Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The LangChain agent MUST expose exactly two tools with distinct responsibilities:

- **`semantic_search`** — vector similarity retrieval for open-ended policy questions
- **`structured_extract`** — Pydantic-typed field extraction for specific data lookups

Rules:
- Tools MUST NOT be merged into one generic tool
- The agent MUST use `create_react_agent` (ReAct pattern) from LangChain
- Every agent response MUST identify which tool was used
- Tool selection logic MUST be driven by LLM reasoning, not hard-coded routing

**Rationale**: Forcing the agent to choose between retrieval strategies is what makes the system *agentic*. A single tool loses explainability and type safety. Interviewers expect this distinction.

### III. Structured Output with Pydantic (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All structured data extracted from documents MUST use Pydantic schemas:

- `PolicyData` model MUST define all eight fields with `Field(description=...)` annotations
- LLM responses for extraction MUST be parsed through the Pydantic output parser
- Unknown/missing fields MUST return `"Not specified"` — never `null`, never hallucinated values
- Schema changes MUST be backward-compatible within v1 of the API

**Rationale**: Type safety at the AI boundary is a core production requirement. Pydantic schemas also serve as self-documenting contracts between the agent and the API consumer.

### IV. Local-First Infrastructure (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The demo MUST run entirely on a local machine without any cloud infrastructure:

- Vector store: **ChromaDB** persisted to `./chroma_db/` — no Pinecone, no Weaviate
- LLM: **gpt-4o-mini** via OpenAI API (only external dependency, requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Embeddings: **text-embedding-3-small** (cost-optimal, good quality)
- No Docker required; `pip install -r requirements.txt` MUST be sufficient to bootstrap backend
- `npm install && npm run dev` MUST be sufficient to bootstrap frontend

**Rationale**: Interview demos must start reliably in under 5 minutes on any laptop. Cloud dependencies introduce failure points that cannot be debugged in a live interview.

### V. Transparency — Show Your Work

Every AI response displayed to the user MUST include:

- The final answer text
- A badge indicating which tool the agent used (`semantic_search` or `structured_extract`)
- The source chunk(s) the answer was derived from, with page reference
- The agent MUST state clearly when it cannot find an answer — no silent failures

Frontend display rules:
- Tool badge: blue for `semantic_search`, green for `structured_extract`
- Source chunk shown in a collapsible expander
- Structured extraction results shown as a formatted table

**Rationale**: Explainability is a first-class requirement for AI systems in regulated industries like insurance. Demonstrating this during the interview directly addresses AMAN's use case.

### VI. Simplicity Over Abstraction

- No over-engineering: implement exactly what CLAUDE.md specifies, no more
- No premature abstractions: three similar lines are better than an unnecessary helper
- No feature flags, no backwards-compatibility shims
- No comments explaining *what* code does — only *why* when non-obvious
- Dependencies MUST be pinned in `requirements.txt` (backend) and `package.json` (frontend)

**Rationale**: A clean, readable codebase demonstrates engineering maturity more than a complex one. The interviewer will read the code.

## Tech Stack Constraints

| Layer | Technology | Version | Notes |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Frontend UI | React.js + TypeScript | 18.x | Vite for bundling |
| Frontend styling | Tailwind CSS | 3.x | Clean, minimal UI |
| Backend API | FastAPI | 0.110.x | Auto-generates OpenAPI docs |
| Backend server | Uvicorn | 0.29.x | ASGI server |
| AI orchestration | LangChain + langchain-ollama | 0.1.x | Agent + chains |
| Vector store | ChromaDB | 0.4.x | Local persistence |
| LLM | llama3.1:latest | — | Local via Ollama |
| Embeddings | nomic-embed-text:latest | — | Local via Ollama |
| PDF parsing | unstructured[pdf] | 0.13.x | With chunking via LangChain |
| Schema validation | Pydantic | 2.7.x | Structured extraction |
| Environment | python-dotenv | 1.0.x | `.env` file for configuration |

**No substitutions** to the above stack without updating this constitution and all dependent specs.

## Development Workflow

1. **Spec first**: Every feature starts with a spec under `specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`
2. **Plan before code**: Architecture decisions are documented in `plan.md` before any implementation
3. **Backend before frontend**: API contracts MUST be defined before React components are built
4. **Test the golden path**: After implementation, manually verify the full upload → ask → answer flow
5. **No partial implementations**: Each phase MUST be complete and runnable before the next begins

### API Contract (Backend → Frontend)

```
POST /api/v1/upload          → { chunks_indexed: int, metadata: obj }
POST /api/v1/ask             → { answer: str, tool_used: str, source_chunks: str[], page_refs: int[] }
POST /api/v1/extract         → { policy_data: PolicyData }
DELETE /api/v1/store         → { cleared: true }
```

## Governance

- This constitution supersedes all other practices and preferences within this project
- Any deviation from a NON-NEGOTIABLE principle requires updating this document first
- Amendments follow semantic versioning: MAJOR for principle removals/redefinitions, MINOR for additions, PATCH for clarifications
- All implementation plans and specs MUST include a "Constitution Check" section verifying compliance with Principles I–VI
- Complexity beyond what is specified here MUST be justified in the plan's Complexity Tracking table
